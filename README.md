# Graph Implementation in C

An implementation of the graph data structure in C, done using adjacency lists.
   
## Features: 

This project is an implementation of the Graph data structure in C using adjacency lists that can perform the following operations on a graph:

1. **Node operations:** Add a node, Delete a node
2. **Edge operations:** Add an edge, Delete an edge
3. **Displaying the graph** via **Depth-First Traversal**, **Breadth-First Traversal** and **Topological Sort**
4. **Detect** whether the graph is **connected** or **disconnected**.
5. **Shortest path** between a **fixed source** to all other vertices (can calculate path as well as path-cost)
6. **Shortest path** between **any pair of nodes**. (can calculate path as well as path-cost)
7. **Searching a value** in the graph via **breadth-first search (BFS)** and **depth-first search (DFS)**
8. Detect the **presence of a cycle in the graph**
9. Calculate and **display the minimum spanning tree** (uses Primâ€™s algorithm for MST)
10. **Display all possible paths** between a pair of nodes

This program is interactive and has a user-friendly menu that lets the user select a choice, and displays useful error information if invalid inputs are entered, and also prints information regarding the request made in certain other situations (like adding a node).

It can operate on weighted/non-weighted and directed/undirected graphs, according to what the user selects.
